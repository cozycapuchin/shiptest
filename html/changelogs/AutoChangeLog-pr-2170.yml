changes:
  - code_imp: ports update_appearance, update_name, and update_desc from tg, as well
      as associated signals
  - code_imp: a bit of base_icon_state implementation. Can you believe it's been sitting
      in our code almost unused for like 3 years
  - code_imp: cleans up some code formatting, mainly around custom icons and overlays
  - code_imp: fixes the typos in COMSIG_STORAGE_EXITED and COMSIG_STORAGE_ENTERED
